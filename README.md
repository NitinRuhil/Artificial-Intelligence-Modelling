# Artificial Intelligence Modelling Project

This repository contains my individual academic work for an Artificial Intelligence course. The assignments are organized as one complete **Artificial Intelligence Modelling Project**.

The project shows the full process of building AI models, starting from data preparation and ending with model evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Prepare and explore data
* Select useful features
* Train machine learning models
* Test and compare model performance
* Interpret and explain results

Each assignment represents one stage of the AI modelling process.
